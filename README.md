## What is UPASS

UPASS monitors the internet daily for matches to your assignment questions. Upon detection of a hit, UPASS sends an email notification. 

UPASS will need to be setup and run on a single computer at your institute, however once setup, it can be used by anyone to submit their assignments to from any computer.

Please note that both a SerpStack account and Google account will be required for UPASS to be setup and run. Both are free, however, you may be required to upgrade your SerpStack account to a subscription plan to have sufficient API requests to run UPASS once several assignments have been submitted.
